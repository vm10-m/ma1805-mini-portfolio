this part is where i tried to use new elements of code e.g 'increment'to apply movement to my existing emoji which i had already created from 01. drawing.
 i replaced some of the axis in the shapes which made up the mouth to make it look like the emoji was blowing a piece of bubblegum.
  i also attempted to add an element of code i came across while researching p5.js templates which was an arc, to add to the emoji and its movement
  , however i had difficulties in making this show up on the live server when i opened it.
